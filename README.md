# MandelbrotJS

An experimental renderer for fractals like the mandelbrot set, written in javascript.

This is currently less of a finished program and more a place for me to test new ideas, tools and rendering algorithms - but I hope some of these will allow me to turn this into an actual high-performance fractal explorer over time.

A working version of this program can be seen on [peabrainiac.github.io/mandelbrotJS](https://peabrainiac.github.io/mandelbrotJS); if you want to run a copy of this locally instead, you can do so by cloning this repository and running `server.py`, which will then serve all files from this folder at `localhost:8080`.
